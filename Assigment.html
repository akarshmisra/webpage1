    <p>Lakhimpur Kheri is a city in northern India’s Uttar Pradesh state. It's home to the iconic Shiv Tempal, The story of Gokaran Nath is same as Vaidyanath. It is the belief of the people that Lord Shiva was pleased with the penance (Tapasya) of Rawana (King of Lanka) and offered him a boon. Rawana requested the Lord Shiva to go to Lanka with him and leave there forever.<br><br><br>        <img style="float:left"src="C:\Users\Akarsh Mishra\Desktop\image\picture 4.jpg" width="250">
The city was first mentioned in the Tretayug, Ravana realised that Lord Shiva did not want the Ling to be carried to Lanka and let Ravana win the war. Enraged Ravana pressed the Ling with his thumb resulting in an impression which looked like a cow's ear (गौ-कर्ण). It is on this basis that the place was named Gola Gokaran Nath
<br>
Today, Lakhimpur Kheri district is a part of Lucknow division, with a total area of 7,680 square kilometres (2,970 sq mi).[1] The national government designated Lakhimpur Kheri as a Minority Concentrated District on the basis of 2001 census data, which identifies it as requiring urgent aid to improve living standards and amenities.
<br><br>
The Shiv Mandir and Laxminarayan Mandir is perhaps the most iconic of all of Lakhimpur kheri's landmarks. </p>
